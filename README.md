# Cyber Home Lab Microsoft Sentinel

## Objective

The Cyber Home Lab project SOC in Azure from scratch. Using a free Azure subscription, I created a Virtual Machine (VM), opening it to the internet as a honeypot, and forwarding logs to a central repository. I then integrate Microsoft Sentinel to analyze real-world attack data.

### Skills Learned

- Creating an Azure subscription and setting up a VM.
- Configuring Log Analytics Workspace.
- Forwarding logs and integrating with Sentinel.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Building an attack map to track real-time hacker activity.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Used Azure VM to create a Windows 11 machine.
- Used Microsoft Sentinel for log ingestion and analysis.
- Within Sentinel, I used Workbooks to create an attack map.
